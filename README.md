# IBM-Employee-Attrition
This end-to-end data science project analyzes HR data to identify key drivers of employee attrition and predict whether an employee is likely to leave. Using IBMâ€™s HR dataset, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and built classification models (Random Forest and Logistic Regression) in Python. The project highlights practical skills in machine learning, model evaluation, and data visualization, with actionable insights to support HR decision-making.

Tools & Techniques
Python: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

ML Models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression

Skills: Data wrangling, EDA, feature importance analysis, classification, evaluation metrics (confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score)
